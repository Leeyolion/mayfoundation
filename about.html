            <h1>About Mays Foundation</h1>
            <p>The Mays Foundation was born from a deep-seated belief in the transformative power of education. We witnessed first hand the devastating impact of poverty and limited opportunities on the lives of children in rural northern Uganda. Countless children were denied the chance to learn and reach their full potential trapped in a cycle of poverty.</p>

By focusing on creating a nurturing and supportive environment, May's Nursery and Primary School is working to break the cycle of poverty through education, empowering children with the knowledge and skills needed to build a brighter future for themselves, their families, and their communities.</p>
